### What is the purpose of Sampler?

Samplers in JMeter allows JMeter to send different types of requests to a server. Samplers are the actual requests, JMeter sends to the web server under test.

Each sampler (except Test Action) generates one or more sample results. The sample results have various attributes (success/fail, elapsed time, data size etc.) and can be viewed in the various listeners. Some important Samplers available are as follows:
