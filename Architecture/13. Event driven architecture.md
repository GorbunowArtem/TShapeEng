## Event driven architecture
Is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.
Event-driven architectures have three key components: 
- event producers 
- event routers
- and event consumers

## Benefits:
- ### Scale and fail independently.
    By decoupling your services, they are only aware of the event router, not each other. This means that your services are interoperable, but if one service has a failure, the rest will keep running. The event router acts as an elastic buffer that will accommodate surges in workloads.
- ### Develop with agility
  You no longer need to write custom code to poll, filter, and route events; the event router will automatically filter and push events to consumers. The router also removes the need for heavy coordination between producer and consumer services, speeding up your development process.
- ### Loose coupling
- ### Responsiveness
             
## Drawbacks:
- ### Need to save data to db and publish event as single transaction
- ### Need to use event broker/messager
- ### Eventual Consistency
## When to use
- Cross-account, cross-region data replication
- Cross-account, cross-region data replication
- Fanout and parallel processing
- Integration of heterogeneous systems. If you have systems running on different stacks, you can use an event-driven architecture to share information between them without coupling.
